# dig333finalproject

My milestones 1 and 2 have kind of blended together and has been a more drawn out process than initially anticipated. I'm still in the process of figuring out how to use the GrovePi attachment with my Raspberry Pi, which will allow me to make use of the sensors that I need for my project. I've almost gotten both the light sensor and audio sensor set up, but I'm still troubleshooting some compatability issues between the Raspberry Pi and GrovePi, especially in the category of software. Hopefully in the next few days I'll have everything sorted out, which will allow me to start linking the data I receive from the sensors to manipulate an audio source. 

Milestone 3:
With the help of Dr. Mundy, I've successfully been able to get data from my GrovePi light sensor. I'm now doing research on capturing and playing back live audio from the WALT radio web stream. (https://embed.radio.co/player/d84812b.html?popout)
